## **1. Introduction**
### **1.1 Purpose**
The Vibes-Based Meal Planner is a full-stack web application that helps users plan meals based on their mood or desired "vibe." The app will provide meal suggestions using external APIs, allow users to schedule meals, and integrate with Google Calendar for event-based meal planning.

### **1.2 Scope**
- Users select a "vibe" (e.g., cozy, energizing, light & fresh), and the app suggests meals accordingly.
- Meal data is fetched using the Spoonacular API, and weather-based meal suggestions are integrated via the OpenWeather API.
- Users can manually schedule meals, including take-out and restaurant options.
- Basic calendar integration for syncing planned meals with Google Calendar.
- Full-stack implementation using **React (frontend), Express.js (backend), and PostgreSQL (via Supabase)**.

### **1.3 Intended Audience**
- Individuals who want a more intuitive and mood-based approach to meal planning.
- Millennials and younger generations who enjoy personalized, user-friendly experiences.
- Potential employers reviewing this project as part of a portfolio.

### **1.4 Definitions & Acronyms**
- **API** â€“ Application Programming Interface
- **MVP** â€“ Minimum Viable Product
- **CRUD** â€“ Create, Read, Update, Delete
- **Supabase** â€“ A managed PostgreSQL database service
- **Spoonacular API** â€“ API for meal and recipe data
- **OpenWeather API** â€“ API for real-time weather data
